- 👋 Hi, I’m @SinthetikIndustries or Sinthetix for short.

- ✨ About my background - I have mostly dabled with web design (HTML, PHP, MySQL, JS/JSX, etc.) making web sites and graphics for customers and running my own things for games I've played. Fair amount of experience with CMS like Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, PHPNuke, PHPBB, and other similar software found on CPanel Hosts w/Softaculous and the Popular Apps everyone knows about. I used to write mIRC/IRCx chat scripts, war bots, dialogs waay back in the day. I have messed around with some programming but mostly related to games, modifying them, and running servers.
